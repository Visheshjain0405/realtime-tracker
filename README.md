Real-Time Location Tracker
This project is a real-time location tracker built using React.js, Express.js, Socket.io, and Leaflet.js. It tracks the user's exact live location and displays it on a map with high accuracy. The app uses geolocation services to capture the user's current latitude and longitude and updates the map in real time as the user moves. The backend is powered by Express.js and Socket.io, enabling efficient communication between the client and server for live updates. Leaflet.js is used to render the map and markers.
